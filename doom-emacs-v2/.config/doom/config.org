;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;       user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
;;
;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;; - `doom-symbol-font' -- for symbols
;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
;;
;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
;; accept. For example:
;;
;;(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 13))
;;
;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:

(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)


;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/.config/doom/")


;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
;;
;;   (after! PACKAGE
;;     (setq x y))
;;
;; The exceptions to this rule:
;;
;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
;;
;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
;; etc).
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

=org-auto-tangle= allows you to add the option =#+auto_tangle: t= in your Org file so that it automatically tangles when you save the document.  I have made adding this to your file even easier by creating a function 'dt/insert-auto-tangle-tag' and setting it to a keybinding 'SPC i a'.

** Remembering minibuffer prompt history
One thing you will do a lot in Emacs is enter text into minibuffer prompts. Everything from M-x, isearch, the describe-* commands, and even the shell modes will receive a lot of input from you over time.

You’ll quickly realize that it would be helpful for Emacs to remember the things you’ve entered into these prompts the next time you use them. That’s where the savehist-mode comes in!

When you enable this mode, you will be able to use M-n (next-history-element) and M-p (previous-history-element) key bindings in almost every minibuffer (and shell) prompt to call up the inputs you used previously for the current command.

I also like to set the history-length to a reasonable number to reduce the impact that reading these history files can have on Emacs’ startup performance.
#+begin_src elisp
;; Save what you enter into minibuffer prompts
(setq history-length 25)
(savehist-mode 1)

#+end_src
** Remembering the last place you visited in a file
Sometimes it’s convenient for Emacs to remember the last location you were at when you visited a particular file. The save-place-mode can help with that!

Once you turn on this mode, Emacs will drop your cursor to the last visited location in any file that you open.
#+begin_src elisp
;; Remember and restore the last cursor location of opened files
(save-place-mode 1)

#+end_src

** Prevent using UI dialog's for prompts
Emacs will show prompts to confirm many different types of actions, and for some of them it shows a graphical dialog box. If you prefer to keep your Emacs workflow more keyboard-focused, you can turn off those dialog box prompts with this setting:
#+begin_src elisp
;; Don't pop up UI dialogs when prompting
(setq use-dialog-box nil)
#+end_src
** Automatically revert buffers for changed files
One thing that can be annoying about Emacs when you first start using it is that it doesn’t automatically refresh file buffers when the file on disk has been changed outside of Emacs. This can often happen when you’re using tools that generate some kind of text file output that you need to read in an Emacs buffer.

The global-auto-revert-mode will make Emacs watch the files for all open buffers for changes on disk and it will automatically refresh those buffers if they don’t have unsaved changes!
#+begin_src elisp
;; Revert buffers when the underlying file has changed
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+end_src
I also like adding the following setting to cause other types of buffers in Emacs to update when related files on disk have changed.

The place this is most useful is when you’re using Emacs’ excellent Dired package! The following setting will cause Dired buffers to be automatically refreshed when files get added or deleted from the directory you are browsing:
#+begin_src elisp
;; Revert Dired and other buffers
(setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)
#+end_src
** a
