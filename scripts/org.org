* Checking for PipeWire Usage

** 1. Check for PipeWire Processes

You can use the following command to see if PipeWire-related processes are running:

    ```bash
    ps -e | grep pipewire
    ```

You should see entries like `pipewire`, `pipewire-media-session`, or `pipewire-pulse`.

- **`pipewire`**: The core media server.
- **`pipewire-media-session`**: Manages media sessions (you might also see `wireplumber` if it's used instead).
- **`pipewire-pulse`**: Provides PulseAudio compatibility layer.

** 2. Verify Audio Server

To verify if PipeWire is handling audio, use:

    ```bash
    pactl info | grep "Server Name"
    ```

If you see something like:

    ```
    Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.55)
    ```

it indicates that while you have PulseAudio tools installed, PipeWire is handling the audio.

Alternatively, check using `pactl` for a PipeWire setup:

    ```bash
    pactl info
    ```

Look for lines that mention PipeWire.

** 3. Check for Screen Recording and Sharing

For screen recording and sharing, PipeWire integrates with tools like `pipewire-pulse` and `pipewire-media-session`.

To see if PipeWire is managing your screen recording and sharing, you can use `wpctl` (PipeWire's control tool):

    ```bash
    wpctl status
    ```

You can also check if the PipeWire service is active:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user status pipewire
    ```

For screen recording, applications that are designed to work with PipeWire should show up as options. For example, you can use tools like `obs-studio` (Open Broadcaster Software) or `kazam`, and check their settings for available sources.

** Additional Checks

1. ** Check if `pulseaudio` is running:

    ```bash
    pgrep pulseaudio
    ```

   If this returns a process ID, PulseAudio is running, which might imply that PipeWire is not handling audio directly.

2. ** Check for `pipewire-media-session` or `wireplumber`:

    ```bash
    pgrep pipewire-media-session
    pgrep wireplumber
    ```

   These indicate media session management, which is part of PipeWire's functionality.

By using these methods, you should be able to determine whether PipeWire is handling your audio, screen recording, and screen sharing tasks.
